# handwriting_recognizer
This is a collaborative project with a friend focused on developing an AI-powered handwritten text recognition system using Python. It utilizes OpenCV for image preprocessing, NumPy for numerical operations, and TensorFlow for deep learning model training to accurately convert handwritten input into digital text.
